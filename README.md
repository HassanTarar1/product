Overview
This is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to set up a SQL database connection and perform basic CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA. The application provides an example entity class Product with fields such as id, name, and description.

The instructions below provide steps for configuring the database connection and running the application.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA
MySQL (or any other supported SQL database)
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/example/spring-boot-sql-database-example.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd spring-boot-sql-database-example
Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

Configure the database connection by updating the application.properties file with your database connection details. For example:

arduino
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
Replace the values for url, username, and password with your actual database connection details.

Run the application:

arduino
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Verify that the application has started by accessing the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.

Usage
The application provides the following RESTful endpoints:

GET /api/products - Retrieves a list of all products.
GET /api/products/{id} - Retrieves a specific product by ID.
POST /api/products - Creates a new product.
PUT /api/products/{id} - Updates an existing product by ID.
DELETE /api/products/{id} - Deletes a specific product by ID.
You can use a tool such as Postman or cURL to test the endpoints. For example:

bash
Copy code
POST /api/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Sample Product",
    "description": "This is a sample product."
}
This creates a new product with the given name and description. You can then retrieve the product using the GET /api/products/{id} endpoint, update it using the PUT /api/products/{id} endpoint, and delete it using the DELETE /api/products/{id} endpoint.

Conclusion
This sample Spring Boot application provides a basic example of how to set up a SQL database connection and perform CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA. You can use this application as a starting point for building your own Spring Boot applications that interact with a SQL database.
